## Install
`bower install perkins`

## These are some things you should know about me, Sir.
- I do my best at following Conventions over Configurations
- My root font size is `font-size: 62.5%; so that I can express rems units as pixels ej. 1.6rem = 16px
- You can edit any variable in your style less file (app.less by default)
- They setup my base font size at 16px `@p-basefont: 1.6rem;`
- Also my unitless line-height is 1.2 `@p-baseline: 1.2;`
- You have access to `@p-white`, `@p-black`, `@p-background-color`, `@p-link-color` and `@p-link-hover` color variables for a quick setup
