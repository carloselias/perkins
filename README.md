# Perkins
#### Design & develop the web faster

## Install
`bower install perkins`

### There are some things you should know about me, Sir.
- I do my best at following Conventions over Configurations
- I force `IE=edge` for lastest IE engine, and use Chrome Frame if installed
- My `viewport` by default without user zoom and support for iPhone 5 bigger screen
- I am a `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` for fullscreen on mobile
- I am truly `handheldfriendly`
- They made me `mobileoptimized`
- I see `cleartype` on Mobile IE

### By design
- My root font size is `font-size: 62.5%; so that I can express rems as pixels ej. 1.6rem = 16px
- You can edit any variable in your my style (app.less by default)
- They setup my base font size at 16px `@p-basefont: 1.6rem;`
- Also my unitless line-height is 1.2 `@p-baseline: 1.2;`
- You have access to `@p-white`, `@p-black`, `@p-background-color`, `@p-link-color` and `@p-link-hover` color variables
